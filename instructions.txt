In the coppeliaSim testing map, on the top navigation bar, click file -> load model -> select "PioneerPlow.ttm" and open it
The model should be loaded into the world, and is ready to go. Simply click play on the simulation and the robot will unfurl its plows and start moving. 
Please do not speed up the simulation as it has an effect on the results and how quickly the robot is able to read information from the sensors.
