In my first activity, I was adding various objects and stimuli to the scene in Training Map 1 in order test the robot and to see how it responds to the new obstacles in its way. I made everything collidable, detectable and renderable in order to make sure that none of the objects are able to do anything too wierd. This can be found in the My_Training_Map 1 included.
In my second activity, I looked to correct any line following by the robot provided in order to test how our robot would respond to the new instructions that were given. To do this, functions from the line-follower mobile robot were taken and added to the Dr12 robot in order to create something that can act based upon the situation such as line following or avoiding obstacles.
